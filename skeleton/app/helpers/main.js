  Main Helper
  
  Methods provided by this helper are exposed in views as `$method`.
  
  This helper inherits the default methods provided by the Helper class,
  available in `corejs.lib.helper`.
  
  You can extend this helper and provide your own methods to be made
  available in all views using the naming convention explained above.
  
  Other helpers expose their methods as `${alias}_method`, alias being
  the Controller Alias they're associated with.
  
  This association is a convention used to better organize and group 
  the functionality associated with each controller. Not a functionality
  requirement.
